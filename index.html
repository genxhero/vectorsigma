        <!-- <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>
            Hundreds of years ago, specifically in 5A 110 of the common calendar, 
            the wizard Blair Fibonacci was exiled from the Cyrillian Empire for 
            opposing the rule of newly crowned Emperor Czernobog.  As part of a vengeance plot, Fibonacci
            created an army of unusual  constructs: animated stone bricks with a mind of their own.  Unfortunately for him, 
            his creations proved too treacherous; they crushed the wizard to death and took over his stronghold.
            Without a mind to guide them the Hedronites forged a nation of their own which they modeled after their creator's own
            experiences with government...but unfortunately for their neighbors, Fibonacci had only known an opressive evil empire ruled by a warlock.
            For centuries they captured humanoid slaves and made war upon the Uplands with very few knowing their true identity.

        <!-- <p>
           In the year 519, a monk by the name of Kam Ieilah came to incite the wrath of the Hedronites, and Kam became convinced that they were likely suspects 
           in the murder of his sensei (spolier alert: they had nothing to do with it).  Kam and his best friend, the ninja Choujo, assailedd the sandstone citadel of
           the Hedronites and were brutalized.  Both adventurers were thrown into the Great River and left for dead.  Kam survived thanks in part to the obstinance of his heart,
           but Choujo was slain.  After recovering and spending a few months in a great training montage, Kam learned how to harness the power of his "Ki", or "life force". Now that his 
           has a viabe means to damage them, Kam has returned to exact justice upon the wicked stone blocks that killed his friend and delayed his quest to find his master's killer.

        <p> Having gathered enough power, Kam stormed the throne room of the King Hedronite. Much to his surprise, the king had a hostage: an elf maiden with a bored expression on her face.
            This was Lluya, ambassador of the Syline forest, who had been captured about a month after Kam's first foray into Hedro City.  What her errand was or how she was captured is unimportant.
            After a fierce battle Kam was victorious - striking the final blow  not in anger, and not in the name of vengeance, but for justice.  Kam emerges from Hedron with a new mission: return Llyua to her people.
            Long story short: he dropped her off at home, was granted the honorable title of elf-friend, and rewarded with a sweet magic cloak.

        <!-- <p>
            Staggering out of the castle, Kam and Llyua were confronted by four Hedronites.

            "You'll never make it out of here alive, human," one said

            "There's hundreds of us, and this city is a labyrinth of stone," said another

            "Aye, and we know it like the backs of...of...er..."

            "The point is, there's a lot of us and you'll never see us coming!"

            Kam waved his hand dismissively and said, "Bring it! I destroyed your king and I'll destroy the rest of ya too"

            With that, Kam heard a voice, nearby...was it coming from...the walls?

            "What? The king is dead?"

            He heard it again, a bit further away, "the king is dead?"  Soon hundreds, no, thousands of voices, crying out in disbelief.

            "The king is dead!"
            "We're free!"

            There was a great rumbling and the sound of stone upon stone as the very universe seemed to quake.  The buildings, the pillars, the road, King Hedro's castle, began to discorporate into constituent blocks of stone.
            A cloud of blocks and bricks of vaious sizes flew around Kam and then they flew away in every direction imaginable.  When the dust cleared the entire city of Hedro was gone, bare of all creatures except for Kam, Llyua, and the four Hedronites.
            Only four.

            Kam laughed, "you were bluffing.  There was only four of you left.  And I ain't even begun to fight!"

            Fearing for their lives, the other Hedronites flew away at supersonic speed.  Onc
