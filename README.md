# Hedron Attack
## Background and Overview



### Motivation for project

To gain a deeper understanding of Javascript and create a product which can be proudly presented to recruiters.  This game will showcase my skill with javascript as well as css and React.

### High level overview

Hedron Attack is an online arcade-style game starring martial artist Kam Zelfarius Ieilah.  A misunderstanding led Kam to run afoul of the Hedronites: evil sentient stone blocks with a penchant for using humans as slave labor.  After having been defeated by the Hedronites before, losing his best friend in the process, Kam returns to put an end to their threat once and for all.
